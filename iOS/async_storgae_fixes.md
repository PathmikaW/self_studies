**Summary of Fixes & Changes for AsyncStorage Issue (iOS Release Build)**

### 1. React Native Dependency Installation
- Installed `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` via:
    ```bash
    npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
    ```

---

### 2. Podfile Clean-Up
- Removed manual `pod 'RNAsyncStorage'` from Podfile (autolinking handles this for RN 0.60+).
- Performed full clean and reinstall of Pods:
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock
    npm install
    cd ios && pod install
    ```

---

### 3. Xcode Build Settings
- Disabled **Dead Code Stripping** (Release configuration):
    - Xcode > Build Settings
    - Search for **"Dead Code Stripping"**
    - Set to `NO` for Release.

---

### 4. Xcode Scheme Changes
- Edited Scheme to explicitly test Release mode:
    - Xcode > Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
    - Set Build Configuration to `Release` for `Run` step.

---

### 5. PersistGate Added to App Entry Point
- Ensured PersistGate wraps the app root component, e.g.:
    ```javascript
    <PersistGate loading={<Splash />} persistor={persistor}>
      <App />
    </PersistGate>
    ```

---

### 6. Full Clean Project Process
- After all fixes, ran full clean:
    ```bash
    npx react-native-clean-project
    ```
- Cleaned Xcode build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder).
- Rebuilt app using:
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-ios --configuration Release
    ```

---

### 7. Extra Debugging Tip (Optional)
- To further debug, you can add a log directly in `RNCAsyncStorage.m` to confirm native module loads.

---

### Outcome
âœ… Persistent storage works correctly in both Debug and Release builds on iOS.
