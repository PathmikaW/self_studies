**Summary of Fixes & Changes for AsyncStorage Issue (iOS Release Build)**

### 1. React Native Dependency Installation
- Installed `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` via:
    ```bash
    npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
    ```

---

### 2. Podfile Clean-Up
- Removed manual `pod 'RNAsyncStorage'` from Podfile (autolinking handles this for RN 0.60+).
- Performed full clean and reinstall of Pods:
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock
    npm install
    cd ios && pod install
    ```

---

### 3. Xcode Build Settings
- Disabled **Dead Code Stripping** (Release configuration):
    - Xcode > Build Settings
    - Search for **"Dead Code Stripping"**
    - Set to `NO` for Release.

---

### 4. Xcode Scheme Changes
- Edited Scheme to explicitly test Release mode:
    - Xcode > Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
    - Set Build Configuration to `Release` for `Run` step.

---

### 5. PersistGate Added to App Entry Point
- Ensured PersistGate wraps the app root component, e.g.:
    ```javascript
    <PersistGate loading={<Splash />} persistor={persistor}>
      <App />
    </PersistGate>
    ```

---

### 6. Full Clean Project Process
- After all fixes, ran full clean:
    ```bash
    npx react-native-clean-project
    ```
- Cleaned Xcode build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder).
- Rebuilt app using:
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-ios --configuration Release
    ```

---

### 7. Extra Debugging Tip (Optional)
- To further debug, you can add a log directly in `RNCAsyncStorage.m` to confirm native module loads.

---

### Outcome
âœ… Persistent storage works correctly in both Debug and Release builds on iOS.



ðŸ“„ Note: Xcode Scheme Changes for Testing Release Build
Steps to Set Scheme to Release Mode in Xcode:

Open your project in Xcode.
Go to the top menu bar:
Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme...
In the left panel, select Run.
On the right side, find Build Configuration.
Change it from Debug to Release.
Click Close to save the changes.
ðŸŽ¯ What This Does
This makes Xcode run your app in Release mode, using the same optimizations, configurations, and stripping as a production build.
This helps catch release-only issues (like AsyncStorage not persisting or Redux state loss).
ðŸ”” Important Reminder
This is still a local build for development devices (it wonâ€™t apply App Store packaging rules like app thinning or encryption). But for testing storage, performance, and release-specific behavior â€” this is the right approach.

By going to Xcode > Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme and setting the Build Configuration to Release for the Run step, youâ€™re telling Xcode to build and run your app using the Release configuration instead of the default Debug one. This tweaks how the app is compiled and executed, aligning it closer to what youâ€™d get in a production release build.

Does It Run Exactly Like a Release Build?
Not 100%, but itâ€™s pretty darn closeâ€”close enough to troubleshoot your redux-persist/AsyncStorage issue. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

What Matches a Release Build
Compiler Optimizations: Itâ€™ll use the Release settings from your Build Settings (e.g., optimization level, code stripping), mimicking how the app is minified and optimized for production.
Preprocessor Flags: Any #ifdef RELEASE or similar flags in your code will activate, matching release behavior.
Performance: Youâ€™ll see the faster execution and reduced debug overhead typical of a release build.
Bundle Structure: The app bundle is built more like a production version (though still signed for development unless you tweak furtherâ€”more on that below).
Whatâ€™s Different
Debugging Support: When you run it via Xcode (even in Release mode), itâ€™s still attached to the debugger. A true release build (e.g., archived and distributed via TestFlight or App Store) doesnâ€™t have this. This might mask some timing or persistence issues, though itâ€™s unlikely for your AsyncStorage case.
Code Signing: Youâ€™re likely still using a development provisioning profile and certificate, not a distribution one. A real release build uses a distribution profile, which can affect sandboxing or entitlements slightly. For AsyncStorage, this rarely matters, but itâ€™s a difference.
Device vs. Simulator: If youâ€™re running on a simulator, some file system or sandbox behaviors might not fully replicate a physical device in release mode. Always test on a real device for accuracy.
Installation Context: Running from Xcode installs the app differently than a .ipa file via TestFlight or the App Store. This can affect initial storage setup, though redux-persist should handle it fine.
Will This Help Your Issue?
For your specific problemâ€”redux-persist not working in iOS release buildsâ€”this setup should be sufficient to replicate the issue. Since itâ€™s failing in release but not debug, the difference likely lies in optimization, file system access, or a stripped dependency. Running in Release mode via Xcode will use the same build settings (e.g., no debug symbols, higher optimization), so you should see the same persistence failure if itâ€™s tied to those factors.

How to Make It Even Closer to a True Release Build
If you want to eliminate the remaining gaps:

Run on a Physical Device: Simulators can be flaky with storage in release mode. Plug in an iPhone or iPad.
Archive and Export: Instead of just running, archive the app (Product > Archive) and export a .ipa with a development profile. Install it via Xcode or a tool like ios-deploy. This skips the debugger entirely.
Distribution Profile: Use an Ad Hoc or App Store distribution profile (requires regenerating the .ipa), but this is overkill unless you suspect signing/entitlements are the issue.
Disable Debugger: In the scheme settings, uncheck Debug executable under Run. This detaches the debugger, though youâ€™ll lose console logs unless you add remote logging.
Practical Answer
For your case, just switching the scheme to Release and running on a physical device should be 95% identical to a true release buildâ€”close enough to catch your AsyncStorage persistence bug. The main differences (debugger, dev signing) are unlikely to affect redux-persist unless youâ€™ve got some weird edge case tied to entitlements or initial app install state.

Next Steps
Run it on a real device with this Release scheme.
Add those logs I suggested earlier (e.g., console.log for persistor rehydration and AsyncStorage.getAllKeys) to see if the storeâ€™s hydrating or if the keys are missing.
Check the Xcode console (or use a tool like react-native log-ios if the debuggerâ€™s detached).
